## Introduction

This project extends the [diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) used for 2D image generation to support 3D volume generation with diffusion models.

This modification was made during my research on medical imaging, hoping to assist those in need of generating 3D volumes with diffusion models.
